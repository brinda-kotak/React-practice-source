Class based components 


Side effects

React > To manage frontend, state, rendering DOM

 - http call, depending on some external events we want to change state, or call a function 5 qty - 50 -first 2 customers delivery free
 
Backend - DB ( http call to get the current / latest - quantity)
 
 On when I add any product to cart - for purchase (I want to revalidate price and stock availability)

constructor   >> it gets called when class is created / object is created : in React its used for setting initial state
ComponentDidMount >> 
ComponentWillMount >>
ComponentDidUnount >> 

everytime -> userEffect (() => {})

only once -> useEffect( () => {
console.log('Brinda'} , [])

only when some state changes
useEffect (() => {
console.log(emailAddress.Length)}, emailAddress)

useEffect (() => {
console.log(contactnumber.Length)}, contactnumber)


Timer based

useEffect( () => {
	setTimeout(()=>{
		console.log(emailAddress.Length) / axios.put(http call)
	},5000)
	
	return () => {
		console.log(cleanup);
	}
}
